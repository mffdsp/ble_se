:name: nRF52840 BLE on Zephyr

# This script runs Zephyr BLE HR demo on nRF52840. It creates 2 machines: `central` and `peripheral`.
# `central` looks for active heart-rate monitors using BLE and establishes 
# a connection to the first device with the strongest signal.
# `peripheral` works as such a monitor and generates dummy heart-rate values.
# Having established the connection, `central` will report heart-rate readings from `peripheral``.

# The `using` command allows the user to omit a prefix when referring to a peripheral.
# Here `using sysbus` allows to refer to `uart0` instead of `sysbus.uart0`. 
using sysbus

# Lines below declare binary files for Zephyr BLE devices. One for central device and one for peripheral device.
# Binaries used here are defaults and can be replaced by changing variables below before running this script.
